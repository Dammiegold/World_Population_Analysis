# Global Population Estimates & Projections

## Analyzing Global Population Estimates & Projections using Power BI
Let's take a look on our Estimates & Projections Data for Analysis.


## Scenario
You work for an NGO which is exploring global population dynamics. You have been provided with a dataset of some key demographic indicators, with estimates provided for the years 1960-2022 and projections for the years 2023-2050. They would like you to explore the data and develop an interactive single screen dashboard to allow policymakers and the public to better understand the data relating to population trends over this timeframe. The dashboard should present aggregated country group level data, based on regional and/or income groupings (a separate Country Groupings file is provided to help with this). You have been given the freedom to focus your dashboard on a specificaspect of the data if you wish (e.g., trends in urban vs rural populations).

## Main Task
Creating a single-screen interactive dashboard which is suitable for the audience and purpose outlined fot our scenario.


## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis was to create an interactive and visually compelling dashboard that enables policymakers and the public to better understand global population dynamics over the period 1960 to 2050. Specifically, the dashboard aimed to provide insights into key demographic indicators such as population growth, life expectancy, birth and death rates, and to illustrate how these metrics vary across different regions and income groups. The dashboard sought to make these insights accessible and actionable, helping users explore long-term trends, identify areas of rapid population change, and observe disparities between countries and regions.

### The analysis also aimed to answer the following specific questions:

1. How has the global population evolved from 1960 to 2022, and what projections can be made up to 2050?
2. What are the growth trends in population across various regions and income groups?
3. How do key demographic indicators (birth rate, death rate, life expectancy, etc.) compare across different countries and regions?
4. What insights can be drawn about urban versus rural population distribution?
5. How do high-level demographic indicators vary by income group, potentially highlighting economic disparities?
